# 🚨 Immersive Disaster Preparedness Platform

## 🧠 About the Project

Traditional disaster education is often theoretical and ineffective during real emergencies. This project bridges that gap by combining **interactive learning**, **gamification**, and **immersive simulations** to help users *experience* disasters before they face them in real life.

From **earthquake response** to **fire safety**, users learn correct actions, apply them in simulated environments, and test their understanding through challenges and assessments.
